      <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in fostering a deep understanding of computer science and AI
        through active learning and hands-on experiences. During my time as a
        tutor at the University of Otago, I focused on guiding students through
        challenging programming and computer science concepts, adapting my
        approach to meet diverse learning styles. I emphasize a student-centered
        approach, providing one-on-one support and encouraging collaboration to
        ensure students grasp fundamental skills in programming, data
        communications, and problem-solving. My goal is to create an inclusive
        and engaging learning environment where students not only build
        technical proficiency but also develop the critical thinking needed to
        apply these skills in practical, real-world scenarios.
